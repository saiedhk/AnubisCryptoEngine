{"name":"Anubis Crypto Engine","tagline":"Anubis Crypto Engine in Verilog","body":"ANUBIS is a block cipher designed by Vincent Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto (2000). Its structure bears large similarity to Rijnadael (AES) and, to this date (2013), it still remains a very strong cipher. An important advantage of Anubis is its involutionary property, meaning that it decryption algorithm is identical to its encryption algorithm. ANUBIS is an iterated 128-bit block\r\ncipher with variable-length keys (128 bits to 320 bits, in steps of 32 bits).\r\n\r\nThe cipher is not patented and has been released by the designers for free public use. The interested reader is referred to\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubis_(cipher) for more information. A URL to the complete definition of ANUBIS is also found in that page.\r\n\r\nThis CodePlex project presents a hardware crypto engine for the ANUBIS block cipher written in Verilog.\r\nDeveloping testbench is work to be done.\r\n\r\nPlease forward suggestions, bug reports and comments to the author of this code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
